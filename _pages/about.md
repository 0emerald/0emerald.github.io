PhD student at the Centre for Doctoral Training in Computational Statistics and Data Science at the University of Bristol, supervised by Professor Emmanouil Tranos and Dr Daniel Lawson.

**Research Interests**
======
My research focuses on developing network science methodologies, alongside using webscraped data and Language Models to model and interpret spatial relationships. The work aims to build out methods for estimating uncertainty in networks, for applications such as anomaly and change point detection. By using large scale webtext data with Language Models, we are able to classify websites, as well as geolocate them, at various timepoints to model dependencies between cities and regions.

**Other Projects**
======
I collaborate on the Smart Data Research project: [An atlas of economic activities in the UK: tapping into web archives for social science research](https://www.sdruk.ukri.org/2024/05/21/funding-new-smart-data-research/), which explores how to create, access, and use the internet as an untapped source of smart data and create tools for the broader science community to use. By building user-friendly pipelines for accessing and filtering web data, we make it possible to curate tailored datasets to suit research topics.
